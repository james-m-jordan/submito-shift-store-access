## In brief
Haczeyni and Jordan et al. report that mitochondrial stress regulates energy utilization by forcing translocation of IM-bound proteins into the matrix.

## Highlights
1. Graph analysis exposes mitochondrial inner-membrane (IM) supercomplexes as histidine-rich pH-sensitive binding docks for 40 matrix soluble proteins.
2. Proton leak weakens protein-protein interactions, releasing the soluble proteins into the matrix.
3. IM-to-matrix translocators partition into regulators of OXPHOS substrate supply and mitochondrial gene expression.
4. ACOT9 illustrates a negative feedback translocator for stress-induced inhibition of mitochondrial activity: dissociates from Complex I upon proton leak, relocates to matrix, deactivates acetyl-CoA, and blunts thermogenesis.
